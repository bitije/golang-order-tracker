Docker needed for `make config`.

Because postgresql and nats streaming are running in containers.

To start:
```
make config
make build
```

If your OS is Linux then `make run` or run binary by yourself.

In other cases run binary depending on your OS.

Then open in browser:
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
